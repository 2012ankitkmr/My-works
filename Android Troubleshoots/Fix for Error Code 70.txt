I've got a solution that might help...(only for error code 70)

1. Open the log file in notepad++ for the error the system has created normally named as [open_gapps_log.txt ].

2.Search for the [Additional Space Required (KB) | 213028(size may vary) ]. let the size be req_size.
3.Now there will be a table given below pen down the apps you wouldn't need(u have to even if you need ;) ).

4.Make sure that the net size of the apps you wrote must be greater than req_size;

5.Open the compressed gapps file. open GApps folder and delete all the files from the archive that you wrote .

6.Now open installer.DATA in notepad++.

7. Under the tag [GApps List (Applications user can Select/Deselect)], Search for the type of Gapps you downloaded[eg. pico_gapps, micro_gapps, mini_gapps,full_gapps ], mine was full_gapps.

8. Now delete the names that you wrote under the [your gapps file name]_list=".

9. Save the file and is now ready to be installed.
